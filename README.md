# üöÄ SIEM Log Ingestion

## üåü Project Overview

Let's be honest, injesting logs from multiple data sources into a SIEM can be a challenging task within SIEM migrations...

You need to identify all the data soruces within an organisation, collate a list of every single log type, determine the best injestion workflow, figure out how you are going to handle migration of threat detection rules etc... its a sticky one. 

I've created this github repo to outline some of the methods which can be leveraged for log injestion into your new SIEM.

## üåü GoogleSecOps

Working with GoogleSecOps(formerly Chronicle SIEM) for this project,
typically (in my opinion) there are 4 ways to get your logs into Chronicle SIEM. 

### Injestion Methods 
 - Direct Injestion from GCP
 - Chronicle Forwarders/Collectors
 - GCP Injestion API
 - Feed/Bucket Syncs

In this repo, we're gonna foucs on **GCP Injestion API** and **Cloud Bucket Sync**. 

### GCP Injestion API
> * **GCP Injestion API** is when you use Google Cloud Platform's API to directly send log data and security events to Chronicle for analysis and storage. This method allows for real-time or near real-time data ingestion, enabling quick detection and response to potential security threats.*
### Feed/Bucket Syncs
> * **Feed/Bucket Syncs** are when Chronicle periodically checks and retrieves data from a designated cloud storage bucket (like Google Cloud Storage) where log files or other security-relevant data are stored. This method is useful for ingesting large volumes of historical data or when low latency real-time ingestion is not required.*

**Direct Injestion from GCP** and **Chronicle Forwarders/Collectorsc** will be covered in another repo soon. 

# Repo Guide

Have a look at this repo in the following order to grasp how to undertake Log Injestion into Chornicle SIEM. 

## section1 - Event Driven Architecture  
 
 - explains event driven arechitecutre concepts and why it is useful for SIEM log injestion

## section2 - REDIS Log Gathering System 
 
 section2a: log injestion setup
 - creates sample logs to work with
 - sets up a watcher to watch the log file and record changes
 - Publishes changes to the REDIS 
 - Creates subscriber to rertieve logs from REDIS

 section2b: adding fault tolerance
 - accounts for what happens when log watcher goes offline
 - determines and how it handles logs missed
 - ensures duplicate logs are not processed 


## section3 - REDIS Log Gathering System with GCS 

 - set up GCS bucket via Terraform to hold our logs
 - create workflow to auto send logs to this gcp bucket 


## section4 - Google Pub/Sub Log Gathering System with GCS 
 
 - switches from using REDIS to Google Pub/Sub 
 - sets up Google Pub/Sub pipelines via Terraform
 - sends logs from subscriber to GCS bucket

## section5 - Google Pub/Sub Log Gathering System with Injestion API 
 
 - still uses Google Pub/Sub instead of REDIS
 - leverages Terraform to set up Google Pub/Sub
 - covers injestion API set up + authentication
 - sends logs from subscriber to Injestion API



## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up your Google Cloud credentials in your CLI
3. Create virtual envrioement (reccomended but optional)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Start the log generator: `python log_generator.py`
6. Launch the log watcher: `python log_watcher.py`
7. Run the log subscriber: `python log_subscriber.py`

> *Don't forget to launch the redis-server when working with section1,section2 and section3 and update authentication/port details if needed*
