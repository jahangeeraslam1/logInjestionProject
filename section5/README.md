# ðŸš€ SECTION 5 - Google Pub/Sub Log Gathering System with Injestion API 

For this section, we'll cover how to send data obtained from Google Pub/Sub to Chronicle via the Ingestion API.

## Ingestion API Info 

- All of Chronicle's REST APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
- Service account JSON credential provided by Google SecOps Partner.
- Authenticate with the Google Malachite-ingestion endpoint first for your http_client, then it will create an authorized http_client object upon success.

### Ingestion API has 4 endpoints

- udmEvents
- unstructuredlogentries
- createentities (for pre-formatted UDM â†’ which removes all reliance on parsing process)
- logtypes (returns list of valid log types)

### Types of Requests with the Ingestion API

- Can do GET request to obtain data from the API endpoint, e.g., what log types it supports receiving.
- Can do PUT request to send data to the API endpoint, e.g., logs for ingestion.

### Sending Unstructured logs to Chronicle

- Unstructured log entries, e.g., syslogs or JSON from an application.

These logs should be present in the correct format for the API endpoint to understand it â†’ wrap it in the correct request body.

- **Body** should be tagged with a logType, so the endpoint understands how to parse the data when it gets received.
- **customer_id** is the key to separate data from different customers and ensure it goes to your instance.
- **Entries** is the log entries with the format beginning with `{"LogText": "entry1KeyValuePair", LogText: "entry2keyvaluepair"}`.

Max Message size is 1MB, so when sending large amounts of messages, you have to be aware of the payload (log entries) and set up batching accordingly.




## Architecture 

Slightly messy but I hope you get the idea. Will transform to draw.io diagram soon.

## Code for Ingestion API Subscriber

We have provided the code below to authenticate with the Ingestion API and incorporate it within our log-subscriber.py file. This will not be run due to not having access to a test Chronicle instance, but it has been provided to show how the Ingestion API should be configured to work with a Google Pub/Sub subscriber.

### Code Changes

Update the imports to access the ingestion API:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.auth.transport.requests import AuthorizedSession
```

### Authorizing with the Ingestion API

You should set the following variables in your file:

```python
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/malachite-ingestion'] # OAuth2.0 scope
ING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = '/path/to/your/service-account-key.json' # JSON key obtained from your Chronicle Google Rep 
CHRONICLE_INGESTION_URL = 'https://malachiteingestion-pa.googleapis.com/v2/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/YOUR_LOCATION/lake:batchCreateLogs' # your custom ingestion URL to your Chronicle instance
```

This function then loads the service account credentials from the file to create an authorized session to handle API requests:

```python
def create_authorized_session():
    credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        ING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, 
        scopes=SCOPES
    )
    return AuthorizedSession(credentials)
```

As mentioned above, we must structure the log being sent to Chronicle in the appropriate format. 

The log_type chosen here will ensure it is being parsed by Chronicle parsers properly, so please select one carefully from the list here... [Google Cloud Chronicle Ingestion API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/ingestion-api)


```python
def send_to_chronicle(session, log_entry):
    body = {
        "customer_id": "YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID",
        "log_type": "YOUR_LOG_TYPE",
        "entries": [log_entry]
    }
    
    try:
        response = session.post(CHRONICLE_INGESTION_URL, json=body)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(f"Successfully sent log to Chronicle: {log_entry}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Failed to send log to Chronicle. Error: {e}")
```

This function:
- Prepares the request body with your customer ID, log type, and the log entry.
- Sends a POST request to the Chronicle ingestion URL.
- Checks for any HTTP errors using raise_for_status().
- Prints a success message if the request was successful, or an error message if it failed.

Error handling is also added to ensure that messages are processed properly:

```python
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error decoding message: {e}")
    message.nack()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error processing message: {e}")
    message.nack()
```
